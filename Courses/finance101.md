As the trading world — like the rest of the world — has moved digital, the game has changed. While financial “experts” can still provide insights and make key decisions, the new heroes are math, statistics, and computer science.


The massive amount of trading data — and the frequency at which trading occurs — is a major reason why quantitative methods and automated algorithms have become a bedrock of Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) sees between 2 and 3 million separate trades on a standard day. The trading hours are  9: 30 30am to 4: 00 00pm ( 23 , 400 seconds).

Thus 100 moves per seconds. 


If money is lent with an annual interest rate of *1%* compounded continuously, about how long would it take for the money to double?

Explanation 
The value of the initial amount,  P, after n years is P⋅ e^(0.01 n) . Setting this equal to � 2P gives � = ln ⁡ ( 2 ) 0.01 ≈ 69.
When the interest rate is this low, it's likely people will look to other forms of investment to get a return on their capital.
