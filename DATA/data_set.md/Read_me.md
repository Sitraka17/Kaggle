# Types of Datasets

Kaggle supports a variety of dataset publication formats, but we strongly encourage dataset publishers to share their data in an accessible, non-proprietary format if possible. Not only are open, accessible data formats better supported on the platform, they are also easier to work with for more people regardless of their tools.
